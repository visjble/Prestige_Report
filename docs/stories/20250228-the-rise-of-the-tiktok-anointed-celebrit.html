                <p>The Last Mogul Standing: Sumner Redstone's Twilight Battle for an Empire</p>
<p>In the opulent corridors of power, where media empires are forged and fortunes shift like tectonic plates, one name looms large: Sumner Redstone. At 97 years old, the storied mogul finds himself embroiled in a pitched battle, not for corporate dominance, but for control over his life's work – a tangled web of assets that spans entertainment, media, and beyond.</p>
<p>From his humble beginnings in Boston, Redstone ascended to the heights of the industry, wielding an iron fist and an insatiable appetite for acquisition. His reign at the helm of Viacom and CBS was marked by audacious power plays, bitter feuds, and a relentless drive to expand his domain. Yet, even as his empire grew, Redstone's personal life descended into a maelstrom of salacious scandals, bitter divorces, and whispers of erratic behavior.</p>
<p>Now, as the twilight of his life casts long shadows, a new chapter unfolds. A cast of players – from his once-trusted lieutenants to his own flesh and blood – jockey for position, each vying for a piece of the Redstone legacy. At the center of this high-stakes drama lies the ailing mogul himself, his mental faculties in question, his iron grip on power slipping.</p>
<p>In exclusive interviews and behind-the-scenes accounts, Vanity Fair pulls back the velvet curtain on this epic power struggle. From the lavish estates of Beverly Hills to the boardrooms of Manhattan, we trace the rise and fall of a titan, exposing the Machiavellian machinations that have shaped the entertainment landscape for generations.</p>
<p>As the battle rages on, one question lingers: Will Redstone's empire crumble under the weight of its own excess, or will a new generation of power players emerge, fortified by the lessons of the past? In this riveting tale of ambition, betrayal, and the insatiable hunger for dominance, the future of an industry hangs in the balance.</p>
