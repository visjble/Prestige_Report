                <p>The echo of those two words – "Me Too" – still reverberates through the halls of power, a seismic shift that toppled titans and shattered the illusion of Hollywood's glamorous facade. At the epicenter of this tectonic upheaval lies the saga of Harvey Weinstein, a cautionary tale of unchecked influence and the insidious culture of complicity that enabled his alleged predations for decades.</p>
<p id="continue-reading">Even as the disgraced mogul awaits yet another criminal trial, the reverberations of his downfall continue to ripple outward. In the aftermath of the explosive allegations that first surfaced in 2017, a deluge of reckonings followed, sweeping away careers and reputations in its wake. The entertainment industry, long accustomed to turning a blind eye to the misdeeds of its powerbrokers, found itself forced to confront harsh truths about the systemic enabling of abusive behavior.</p>
<p>Yet, for all the public contrition and pledges of reform, the true depth of Hollywood's reckoning remains a matter of heated debate. Have the hard-won victories of the #MeToo movement ushered in lasting change, or merely scratched the surface of a deeply entrenched culture of exploitation? As new voices emerge to share their stories, and legal battles rage on, the enduring consequences of the Weinstein saga continue to unfold, laying bare the complex tapestry of power, privilege, and accountability that underpins the dream factory's gilded halls.</p>
<p>Through exclusive interviews with key players and an incisive analysis of the movement's lasting impact, this investigative deep-dive peels back the layers of a scandal that shook the very foundations of Hollywood, exposing the fault lines that run through an industry forever changed by the courage of those who dared to speak out.</p>
