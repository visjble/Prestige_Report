                    <p>The Lingering Shadow of a Fallen Titan</p>
                    <p>In October 2017, the entire landscape of Hollywood was irrevocably reshaped by a searing investigative report that exposed Harvey Weinstein's legacy of alleged sexual misconduct stretching back decades. The revelations unleashed a torrent of accounts from industry figures sharing their own stories of abuse and intimidation at the hands of one of the most powerful producers in the business. For years, Weinstein's outsize influence and pugnacious tactics had allowed him to operate with impunity, shielded by a circle of loyalists and enablers. But as his accusers found their voices amidst the viral rise of #MeToo, the dam burst and a tidal wave of pent-up fury flowed forth.</p>
                    <p>The staggering downfall of the Miramax and Weinstein Company mogul reverberated far beyond Hollywood as women across industries and social strata drew inspiration from the bravery of the "Silence Breakers." From the factory floors to the halls of Congress, survivors were emboldened to come forward and speak truth to entrenched power structures long stained by secrecy and complicity. The #MeToo awakening exposed not just individual predators, but systemic failures to address harassment and discrimination plaguing every sector.</p>
                    <p>As accusation after accusation emerged from the shadows, stretching from production assistants to A-list talent like Ashley Judd and Gwyneth Paltrow, Weinstein's repugnant modus operandi was laid bare – relying on a mix of threats, payoffs, and career sabotage to silence his prey. While his stunning fall from grace culminated in a shattering court conviction, the fallout rippled across Hollywood's elite. Industry heavyweights were exposed as exploiters, while others were rocked by secondary allegations that prompted professional purgings and frantic damage control.</p>
                    <p>More than five years later, the #MeToo movement remains a decisive inflection point that catalyzed profound shifts in attitudes, institutional reform, and heightened accountability – albeit with uneven progress. Through insider accounts from the trailblazing accusers and dogged investigators who brought down Harvey Weinstein, Vanity Fair's oral history examines the seismic impact of this pivotal cultural moment. From the whispers of an open secret that turned into a roar heard around the world, the reverberations of the Weinstein Effect transformed Hollywood forever.</p>
