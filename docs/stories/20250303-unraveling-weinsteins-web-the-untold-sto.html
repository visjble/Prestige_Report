                <p>Here is a 300-word feature for Vanity Fair based on the selected idea:</p>
<p id="continue-reading">"Billionaire Bunkers: The Ultra-Rich's Obsession with Doomsday Prepping"</p>
<p>In the rarified world of the tech billionaire elite, a new obsession is taking hold: the race to develop the most exquisite and impregnable private refuge to survive society's potential collapse. From former software moguls to crypto cowboys, a growing enclave is pouring unlimited resources into crafting ultra-luxurious underground bunkers and secluded sanctuaries, designed to withstand apocalyptic catastrophes of every ilk.</p>
<p>For these modern sovereigns, the scale of such projects is limited only by the depths of their fortunes and the contours of their worst nightmares. One Bay Area titan has commissioned not just a sprawling subterranean shelter, but an entire clandestine village concealed beneath a pristine New Zealand meadow. A famed investor has turned a decommissioned Cold War missile silo into a veritable penthouse in the earth, outfitted with every indulgence.</p>
<p>But for the chosen few granted access, life in these privatized arks will hardly resemble the privations of conventional doomsday prepping. One former gaming magnate has enlisted celebrated architects and designers to transform his multi-billion-dollar, former Soviet military bunker into a self-sustaining luxury paradise. Beyond a DNA vaulting system to preserve humanity's elite genetic pool, lavish amenities include an aquaculture farm, Morocco-inspired spa, bowling alleys and a climate-controlled oenophile's heaven stocked with the rarest vintage reserves.</p>
<p>As the first members of this insular redoubt begin furtively going to ground, troubling moral and ethical questions loom. What divides the worthy from the damned when the endgame beckons? Is there space on these gilded life rafts for the learned few beyond those who can pay the ultimate high-priced admission? For this burgeoning cult of neo-Noahs, the future may prove as ethically bleak as the apocalyptic visions that birthed their obsession.</p>
