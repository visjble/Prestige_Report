# The Prestige Report

## About
The Prestige Report is an AI-powered digital magazine that publishes a new story every day. Drawing inspiration from prestigious publications, we offer sophisticated narratives on culture, fashion, and high society. Our stories explore the world of luxury and influence through the lens of creative fiction.

## Concept
This project explores the philosophical question posed by Aristotle in his Metaphysics: can fiction reveal deeper truths than literal facts? In a post-information age where veracity is increasingly difficult to establish, The Prestige Report embraces acknowledged fiction as a vehicle for insight.

Each day, our AI system:
1. Generates compelling story ideas
2. Crafts a polished narrative in the style of prestigious magazines
3. Automatically publishes the story to our website

## Technical Implementation
The Prestige Report runs on a Python-based system that leverages the Anthropic Claude API to generate content. The system includes:

- `story_generator_02.py`: Core script that handles the content generation workflow
- Editor and Writer agents that collaborate to create each story
- Automated publishing to a static website 
- Daily scheduling through GitHub Actions

## Legal Notice
All stories published by The Prestige Report are works of AI-generated fiction. While inspired by real-world contexts, personalities, and events, these narratives are entirely fictional and should not be interpreted as factual reporting.
